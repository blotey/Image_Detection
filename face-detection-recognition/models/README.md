# Face Detection and Recognition Models

This directory contains the models used in the Face Detection and Recognition system. The models are designed to detect and recognize human faces from images and video streams using machine learning techniques.

## Model Architecture

1. **Face Detection Model**:
   - Utilizes Haar Cascade or other deep learning-based methods for detecting faces in images.
   - Outputs bounding boxes around detected faces.

2. **Face Recognition Model**:
   - Extracts facial embeddings from detected faces using a pre-trained model.
   - Classifies and recognizes faces based on the extracted embeddings.

## Training Process

- The models are trained using a dataset of labeled images, where each label corresponds to a unique individual.
- The training process involves:
  - Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
  - Extracting embeddings for each face.
  - Training a classifier on the embeddings to recognize faces.

## Usage

- The trained models can be used for real-time face detection and recognition in various applications, such as security systems, user authentication, and interactive systems.

## Requirements

- Ensure that the following libraries are installed:
  - OpenCV
  - NumPy
  - [Any additional libraries used for model training and evaluation]

## Future Work

- Explore advanced techniques for improving detection and recognition accuracy.
- Implement additional features such as emotion detection or age estimation.
